Task 1: Middleware Playground
===============================

Objective: Create and register middlewares: logger, timer, custom header injector.
Log the sequence of execution for each request.

Implementation:
1. Logger Middleware - logs request details with timestamps
2. Timer Middleware - measures response time
3. Custom Header Middleware - injects custom headers
4. Shows middleware execution order

Key Features:
- Request logging with unique IDs
- Response time tracking
- Custom headers injection
- Clear demonstration of middleware chain

To run: node task-01.js
Server runs on: http://localhost:3000

Test commands:
curl http://localhost:3000/
curl http://localhost:3000/api/users
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/users -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"John"}'

Expected output shows middleware execution sequence.
