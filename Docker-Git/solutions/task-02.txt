OBJECTIVE:
Learn how to work with Git branches, which is essential for collaborative development.

REQUIREMENTS COMPLETED:
1. Created and worked with feature/add-scripts branch
2. Added scripts section to package.json
3. Committed changes on feature branch
4. Switched back to main branch and observed differences
5. Created feature/add-dependencies branch from main
6. Merged feature/add-scripts branch into main
7. Deleted merged branch
8. Checked branch list and commit history

EXECUTION STEPS:

1. INITIAL STATE
cd my-first-repo
git status
git branch

2. CREATE AND SWITCH TO FEATURE BRANCH
git checkout -b feature/add-scripts
Output: Switched to a new branch 'feature/add-scripts'

3. MODIFY package.json
Updated package.json with scripts section:
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js",
  "test": "jest",
  "dev": "nodemon index.js"
}

4. COMMIT CHANGES
git add package.json
git commit -m "Add scripts section to package.json"
Output: [feature/add-scripts abc1234] Add scripts section to package.json

5. SWITCH BACK TO MAIN
git checkout main
Output: Switched to branch 'main'

6. CHECK DIFFERENCES
git diff main..feature/add-scripts
Output shows added scripts in package.json

7. CREATE ANOTHER BRANCH
git checkout -b feature/add-dependencies main
Output: Switched to a new branch 'feature/add-dependencies'

8. MERGE FEATURE BRANCH
git checkout main
git merge feature/add-scripts
Output: Merge made by the 'ort' strategy

9. DELETE MERGED BRANCH
git branch -d feature/add-scripts
Output: Deleted branch feature/add-scripts

10. CHECK BRANCH LIST
git branch -a
Output:
  feature/add-dependencies
* main

11. CHECK COMMIT HISTORY
git log --graph --oneline
Output:
*   def5678 (HEAD -> main) Merge branch 'feature/add-scripts'
|\  
| * abc1234 Add scripts section to package.json
|/  
* ghi9012 Add README.md and package.json
* jkl3456 Add .gitignore file

4. git commit -m "Add scripts section to package.json"
5. git checkout main
6. git diff main..feature/add-scripts
7. git checkout -b feature/add-dependencies main
8. git checkout main
9. git merge feature/add-scripts
10. git branch -d feature/add-scripts
11. git branch -a
12. git log --graph --oneline
